\section{Teamwork}

During this sprint, Benjamin, Romain, Zacharie and Alexandre worked mainly on the documentation as, at the beginning of the sprint, we were previously far behind schedule for it. Benjamin also realized and edited the various presentation video that were delivered for our website. \newline

Cyril worked on the classement verification system and once more updated the various diagram and worked on the report in general. \newline

As for Quentin, Nicola and Florian, they worked on the code to finish various features and fix major bugs. They also took it upon themselves to rush the last few day to implement the various remarks we received during the reunion with the client.
