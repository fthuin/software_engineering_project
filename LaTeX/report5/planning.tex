\section{Planning}

As you can see on the following planning, we are still on schedule as we have now nearly finished our implementation. All that is left is a few minor bugs and unperfected feature which we still have to work on. A small team also rushed to implement the various remarks that we received during the reunion with the client, which are now fully implemented. \newline

The only things that will be left to modify in the code for the last sprint will thus be various minor bug fixing and the polishing of some remaining secondary features.
