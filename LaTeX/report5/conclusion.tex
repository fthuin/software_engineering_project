\section{Conclusion}

During this sprint, we mainly worked on catching back on the documentation and finishing the website implementation. We implemented the various requirement of the client that we received previously and took it upon ourselves to rush and modify the website according to the comments received during the reunion with the client. \newline

During the next sprint we will work on correcting the remaining minor bug, on re-factoring the code (as to make it easier to modify for someone who didn't contribute in the development) and on
preparing the final presentation.
