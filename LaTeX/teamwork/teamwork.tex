\section{Teamwork}

\subsection{Romain}
The overall teamwork of the group is really good: the workload is nicely
split between all the members for each sprint; the weekly meetings allow
us to evaluate the progress of the project; the group leader assures that
everything goes according to the initial planning, and everybody is ready to
help if something takes more time than expected. \newline

\subsection{Benjamin}

This project lets us work as a small team, in conditions that are closer to the working world than any other academic project we had. The group has to be very careful on the planning, but our team is capable of efficiently splitting the work among the members until now. The work is accomplished, and only external things, such as a bunch of unexpected work from other courses, have a bad impact on our work flow for this project. \newline

Furthermore, the atmosphere of the group gives motivation to all of us: everyone stays ready to help anyone, avoiding the group to stuck indefinitely on a bug.

It is a significant amount of work to create a website following very
special requirements that are not directly explained in a technical way.
The work is sometimes much more or much less important than we can imagine and
managing a team of eight people is also a challenge. Fortunately, my
teammates are all qualified to help in at least one part of the workload for
each sprint and everyone is pretty self-governing. \newline

The main difficulty so far is to push everyone to deliver his work part by
part (beginning by the structure and then producing a step-by-step
implementation ; each time with a commit on the git) to ensure the progress
of the tasks and to help when other team members have free time.
Personally, I feel that everyone does what he can, despite the workload in
the first year of master which limits the time left for this project.\newline
\subsection{Cyril}

I have no problem with the team in general, everything is proceeding
smoothly along the way as everyone accomplish the task they have been given
flawlessly. In short, everything is close to perfect in the team in my
opinion and I hope it stays this way until the end of the project.
