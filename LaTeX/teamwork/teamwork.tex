Cyril:

I have no problem with the team in general, everything is proceeding smoothly along the way as everyone accomplish the task they have been given flawlessly. In short, everything is close to perfect in the team in my opinion and I hope it stays this way until the end of the project.

Romain :

The overall teamwork of the group is really good: the workload is nicely split between all the members for each deadline, the weekly meetings allow us to evaluate the progress of the project, the group leader assures that everything goes according to the initial planning and everybody is ready to help if something takes more time than expected.
