\section{Conclusion}

This sprint was very productive but we were working on the requirements we set in the first sprint. Meanwhile, we received new requirements or modified requirements from the client on Moodle and we didn't had time to change our website to be consistent with them. The planning for the next sprint will certainly change as we will have to modify some features of our website and organize the meeting with the client.
