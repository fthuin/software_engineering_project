\section{Teamwork}

We had organized the work in the same way we did for the last sprint. \newline

Cyril, Nicolas, Quentin and Florian create the staff part with the permissions management, the history page, a new display of the information following comments of the project leader during the weekly meeting. They also improved and create features for the mailing system of the website. They started to create auto-generated PDF files from data inside the website. \newline

Romain, Alexandre, Zacharie and Benjamin improved a lot the tournament management allowing the staff to create size-changing poules (and print it) and save their scores. They are still working on the knockoff tournament brackets, which are not available for this sprint because this part is not good enough to play with. \newline
