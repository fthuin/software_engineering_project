\section{Teamwork}

This time, Cyril worked on the mailing system of the website, updated the class diagram and produced the sequence diagram. \newline

As for the last sprint, Romain, Zacharie, Alexandre and Benjamin improved the tournament management to save, print and create the multiples parts needed by the client but it wasn't finished for the end of this sprint. As the project manager saw that this part of the website was hard to implement and was falling behind, Florian, Quentin and Nicolas coded another tournament management system to be sure that the \enquote{must-have} requirements would be available right-on-time. Florian, Quentin and Nicolas also coded the history management, the permissions management \newline

For the next sprint, we will make sure that we don't do the work twice and we will split the work in tasks that can be delivered with a better sureness. \newline
