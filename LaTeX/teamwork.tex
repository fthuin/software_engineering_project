\section{Teamwork}

\todo[inline]{Do not hesitate to add anything}

For this first deadline, we had to collect all the requirements in the
paperwork to estimate the related workload. We based our poker planning
on Alexandre's work which was the most complete and decided all together the
amount of work needed by each requirement. We wrote this document
together thanks to \LaTeX  and GitHub.\newline

Quentin and Nicolas oriented us towards some frameworks (Django,
Bootstrap) they already used that everyone agreed to learn to use for
this course. They wrote why our development method choice is the best
for us. It seems like everyone is in a good mood to give the best of
himself to learn and work. We're very happy about that. \newline

Alexandre, Romain, Benjamin, Cyril, Florian and Zacharie worked on the
review of the requirements, the user stories, the use cases, the
diagrams, to set up the Trello,\ldots So that everything we can start
working on the website as soon as we finished the wireframes and
mockups. \newline
