\section{Teamwork}

For this first deadline, we had to collect all the requirements in the
paperwork to estimate the related workload. We based our poker planning
on Alexandre's work which was the most complete and decided all together the
amount of work needed by each requirement. We wrote this document
together thanks to \LaTeX  and GitHub.\newline

Quentin and Nicolas oriented us towards some frameworks (Django,
Bootstrap) they already used it in the past and easily convinced everyone of the various advantages that the use of those framework would bring in this project. They were also in charge of specifying our development method and justifying it.

Alexandre, Romain, Benjamin, Cyril, Florian and Zacharie worked on the
review of the requirements, the user stories, the use cases, the
diagrams, the set up of Trello,\ldots So that everything is ready to start
working on the website as soon as we finished the wireframes and
mockups. \newline

In short, a good ambiance reign in our group and, while dividing the workload equally between eight people was pretty difficult during this particular phase of the project, everybody participated in the completion of this report by realising their given task to the utmost.
