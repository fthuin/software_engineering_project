\section{Teamwork}

For this first deadline, we had to collect and analyze all the requirements in the
paperwork, in order to estimate the related workload. We based our poker planning
on Alexandre's work, which was the most complete at the moment, and decided all together the
amount of work needed by each requirement statement. We wrote this document
together thanks to \LaTeX  and GitHub.\newline

Quentin and Nicolas oriented us towards excellent web frameworks (Django,
Bootstrap) they already used in the past, and easily convinced everyone of the various advantages that the use of those frameworks would bring in this project. They were also in charge of specifying our development method and justifying it.

The rest of the team, Alexandre, Romain, Benjamin, Cyril, Florian and Zacharie, worked on the analyze of the requirements, by producing the user stories, the use cases diagrams, the
activity diagrams, the set up of Trello,\ldots So that everything is ready to start
working on the website as soon as possible. \newline

In short, we created a good atmosphere in our group and, while dividing the workload equally between members was pretty difficult task during this particular phase of the project, everybody participated in the completion of this report by doing their given task to their utmost.
