\section{Introduction}

In this report, we will discuss various points that must be decided before
starting the implementation of the website. Those points are as follow :
First, we will discuss our advancement in the current planning. Then we will present the software architecture that we choose to use and extensively motivate this choice according to the project at hand. After that, we will once again motive our choice of framework but more
extensively this time as it has to implement our architecture perfectly. From there we will then present the planned implementation of our database via an ORM diagram and the current planned design of the website via wireframes. \newline

Finally we will present the class diagram of our current implementation followed by a corresponding sequence diagram. We will then conclude this report after a short section speaking of the teamwork in our group.
