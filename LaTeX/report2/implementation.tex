\section{Current implementation}

We invited some assistants and teaching assistants this week to our private GitHub repository
(\url{https://github.com/fthuin/software_engineering_project}), where we
share the website code in the directory named \textit{ASMAE}, and these reports in the
directory \textit{LaTeX}. For this sprint, the website only has a home page
and the link to the form to create a new user account. We will host
our website on \textit{Heroku} for the next deadline so everyone can try to
use it (we will provide you user accounts) and you will see our progress
very easily. \newline

We also sent some screenshots to the client and we hope to get some
feedback to bond as much as possible to their expectations. \newline
