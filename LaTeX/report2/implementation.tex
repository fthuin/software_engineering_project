\section{Current implementation}

We invited some assistants and teaching assistants this week to our private GitHub repository
(\url{https://github.com/fthuin/software_engineering_project}), where we
share the website code in the directory named \textit{ASMAE}, and these reports in the
directory \textit{LaTeX}. For this sprint, the website only has a home page
and a link to a form providing a way to create a new user account. We will host
our website on \textit{Heroku} for the next sprint, so that everyone can play with it
and you will see our progress very easily.. We will provide you the user accounts.
