For this second deadline, we once more separated the work according to the workload. Everybody did his best and fulfilled his assigned part in due time. We also managed to surpass our original planning by implementing a small prototype of the website.

In short, not only did we fulfil our original planning thanks to our teamwork, we also went farther than that by providing a working prototype of the website online.
