\section{Teamwork}

For this first sprint, our team was divided into smaller groups : 2
teammates provided the database modeling and website prototype ; 2 teammates
worked on the architecture choices and Gantt chart ; 4 teammates worked on
the wireframes. Thanks to this organisation, every could work on a part of
the project and the team has come with everything needed right on time.\newline

Long story short, not only did we fulfil our original planning thanks to our
teamwork, we also went farther than that by providing a working prototype
of the website online.
