\section{Conclusion}

As you have seen in this report, we perfectly attained our planned goal, and
even slightly surpassed it. Great care was put in construction of the
various diagrams and wireframes presented in this report. A Gantt chart was
included according to the feedback received during our meeting with the project leader. \newline

This concludes this report on our current progress in the implementation of
the website. We shall continue to do our best to deliver this same level of quality
during the following weeks of development.
