\section{Class diagram and sequence diagram}

Let's come back to our current implementation of the database and website we previously discussed. In this section, you will find the class diagram of our current implementation. Since this diagram is bound to change, we will update it in the following reports.

This small diagram still allowed us to implement the whole registration of new users on the website. The procedure to register on the website is described in the following flow diagram.
