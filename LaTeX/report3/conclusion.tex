\section{Conclusion}

As you have seen in this report, we haven't achieved our planned goal due to a lack of time and some miss-planning. We have nonetheless accomplished the heaviest part of the work. \newline

This concludes this report on our current progress of the website implementation. We shall continue to do our best during the following weeks of development.
As we will have more time during the next sprint, we will work as hard as possible to make up for our lateness and catch back the pace of the original planning.
