\section{Teamwork}

For this sprint, we will explain how the work has been split among the team members. \newline

Florian deployed the website on the Heroku Platform and implemented a script to easily batch many users in the database, where each user has randomly generated data that are created
with \url{en.fakenamegenerator.com}. With this, we can try how our website can keep up with a relatively big amount of users, on a local environment with sqlite3 
or on Heroku with the PostgreSQL database). \newline

Nicolas and Quentin did the main theme of the website, allowing everyone to
start from a very nice template. They also implemented the home page, the management of the pairs, the
courts, the extras, and the display of some useful information about the
participants, i.e. court owners and players. \newline

Zacharie, Benjamin, Romain and Alexandre worked on the group management,
the tournament management and the group leaders assignment. Alexandre worked mainly on the logic of the groups creation, while Zacharie, Benjamin, and Romain worked on Django integration, layout formatting, and code debugging. \newline

Finally Cyril worked on setting up the various email-related mechanisms that are needed to share information with all the users, and he updated the class diagram and the report.
