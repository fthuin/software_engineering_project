\section{Teamwork}

For this iteration, we will describe how we obtained this result thanks to
each member's work. \newline

Florian deployed the website on the Heroku Platform and created a program
to populate the database easily with randomly generated identities created
with \url{en.fakenamegenerator.com} so that we can try how our website react
when we have a huge amount of people (on a local environment with sqlite3
or on Heroku with the PostgreSQL database). \newline

Nicolas and Quentin did the main theme of the website allowing everyone to
start from a nice template, an home page, the management of the pairs, the
courts, the extras and the display of some useful information about the
participants (owners and players). \newline

Zacharie, Benjamin, Romain and Alexandre worked on the group management,
the tournament management and the leader choice. Alexandre mainly worked on the logic of the groups creation, while Zacharie, Benjamin, and Romain worked on Django integration, layout formatting, and code debugging. \newline

Finally Cyril worked on setting up the various mails sending functions needed to share information with the various player and updating the class diagram.
