\section{Current implementation}

We deployed the application online on the Heroku platform, so that you can play with the current state of the website. It is available at \url{asmae.herokuapp.com}. This
service is free, so the website cannot stay more than 18 hours a
day without manually re-deploy it. We will try to make it online 18h/day, at least from 12PM to 4PM each day.\newline

You can find the current source code of the website on our private GitHub
repository at \url{https://github.com/fthuin/software_engineering_project}
(you need to be logged in to see it, as it is a private repository).
