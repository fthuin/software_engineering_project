\section{Planning}

In this sprint, we planned to implement the first 30 must-have requirements. We underestimated the time we had to work for this sprint, as each group member had at least 3
other course projects at the same time, and that the 24h VÃ©lo took place at Louvain-la-Neuve last week. \newline

Here is the list of the tasks we planned to implement, the
\color{green!60!black}{green} \color{black}ones are done,
the \color{orange!80!black} orange \color{black} ones are partially done, the
\color{red!80!black}red \color{black} ones aren't implemented yet.

\begin{enumerate}

        partial information (such as part of the name of one of the
        players)

    \item Already existing courts are detected and updated upon
        registration (maybe manage courts with owner account)
\color{green!60!black}
    \item Courts receive an identification number upon creation (= new
        registration)

    \item Staff members can look and search for courts, using the same
        features as for pairs of players (by ID or partial information)

        matches based on wishes and court availability
\color{red!80!black}

\color{orange!80!black}
    \item Players receive an email with the address of the court where
        their group has to play in the morning
    \item Group leaders, member of groups, are assigned
    \item Players with payment issues receive an email with the address
        of HQ, inviting them to come and solve the payment issue there
        before the morning matches
    \item Group leaders receive an email with the address of HQ,
        inviting them to come and get the score board there before the
        morning matches
    \item Staff members can create groups with a friendly interface
\color{red!80!black}
    \item Groups are printable as a score board
    \item Staff members can encode the match results
\end{enumerate}

As you can see, half of them have been fully done. The other half, in orange and red, remains unfinished or simply not started. Although we did about 50\% of the requirements, it represents about 75\% of the work. Our planned goal for this sprint was almost impossible to achieve due to the fact that we did not take the other course projects into account.
