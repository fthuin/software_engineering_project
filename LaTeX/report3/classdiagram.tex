\section{Class diagram}

This is the class diagram of the current website implementation. As you can see, our current implementation has grown significantly during this sprint, thanks to the addition of various classes. \newline

Some attributes have been added to participant class, and participants are now linked to the new court and pair classes, so we can name the owner of any court ot name the players of any pair. The pair class has been linked to the new class extra, which allows payment computation, so that we know the total price the pair has to pay for the registration. A tournoi class has been added, and is link to the pair, so that when a pair is created, a particular tournament is associated to the pair. \newline

Of course, since this diagram is leading to change in the future, we will update it in the following reports.
