We met many times to start this project. However, we know that our
schedules don't permit that every week, we will have to meet only once a
week (on Wednesday). There we will share our ideas and problems ;
other tools like Trello and GitHub will also improve our vision about
progression of the project. However, part of the team will meet on an ad
hoc basis according to the tasks. Here is our first schedule : \newline
