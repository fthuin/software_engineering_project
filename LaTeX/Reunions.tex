We met many times to start this project. However, we know that our
schedules don't permit that every week, we will have to meet less
frequently but at least once a week. Wednesday will be the day of
meeting where we will show our work and share ideas and problems ;
other tools like Trello and GitHub will also improve our vision about
progression of the project. Here are the dates where everyone is
available for a meeting and the deadlines ; parts of the team will
certainly meet way more often than weekly. \newline
