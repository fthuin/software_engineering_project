\section{Choice of the development methodology (25/09/2015)}

\subsection{Software development method}
\subsubsection{What is Agile?}

Agile is a methodology for software developement. It is iterative which means it is based on tide cycles. Those cycles start with the requirements of what is going to be done during that period of time.
It is followed by the analysis, design and coding. After that comes the testing and it ends with the evaluation of the cycle.
It favors quick meetings and short documentations over huge requirements that are frozen at the beginning of the projet coupled with a huge documentation.
Agile is based on time and not on features. We have a certain periode of time to try to at least do a certain number of features. If there is some time left , we can keep going and implements another one.
Is is also very colaborative and for the most part requiers the whole team to work together.

\subsubsection{Why use agile for this project?}

This project has features in different categories (Must have,Should have,Could have,Would like to have). If we used a non agile methodology, we would have to chose at the very begining all the features that we want to implement.
It is not an optimal solution for an university project since we have some other work to do. It is very hard at the begining of the semester to know how much we will be able to implement. This is why it is interresting to use a methodology that favorise change like Agile.
We are also used to code in a Agile way since we started having project. In team project we would always code with different poeple working on the same project to exchange idea or coordonate in an easier way.
We have weekly meetings with the project leader which fits well for Agile since we have to deliver something every week.
To conclude, there might be some more busy weeks because of other classes assignments and an agile methodology will allow us to be more flexible on the features we will implement during a periode.

\subsubsection{Development method}
Scrum is an agile methodology to manage a project and is usually used to manage software development. It's more of a framework for managing process than a real methodology.\newline

The main idea behind scrum and behind agile methodology in general is not to provide a full detailed description of how everything has to be done. It leaves it to the scrum software development team who will know best how to solve those problems. We speak about the desired outcome not the implementation details.\newline

There is two mains roles in Scrum. The ScrumMaster, a coach really, helping the team members to use the scrum process to perform at the highest level. And the Product Owner (PO) who is the customers or users and guides the team toward building the right product. In our case it is the ASBL.\newline

Scrum works with a backlog containing the list of all the functionality. This list is ordered and the team always works on the most valuable features first. This backlog is created at the start of the project. It's usually composed of user stories which is a short descriptions of functionality described from the perspective of a user or a customer.\newline

Scrum works with sprints. It's a short period of item from one to four week long (usually two weeks) where the team works and provide a potentially shippable product at the end of it. There is a planning meeting at the start of each sprint. During the meeting the team decide how many items they can commit to. The sprint backlog is then created. All those features will be done, coded, tested and integrated with the evolving product. At the end of each sprint, the team show to the PO their work and he can provide feedback that could influence the next sprint. This may lead to add, remove or revise items in the product backlog.\newline

We decide to choose \enquote{Agile} and Scrum as a development method because
everyone in the team worked at least once with this method (in the 4th
project of computer science bachelor) and it fits perfectly with this
kind of project with 8 team members.\newline

\subsubsection{Back End development}
The back end handles everything related to the web server and the database. Using a framework will allow us to focus on the website development without worrying too much about security,use management, administration panel, etc.\newline

We are going to use \textbf{Django}, an open-source framework, for the back-end. It has a large community and is easy to learn. Some group members already have experience with this framework which is gonna make it easier for everybody to get started quickly.\newline

Another advantage of \textbf{Django} is the database management. \textbf{Django} uses Django-ORM which makes it really easy to communicate with the database. Django-ORM writes the SQL statements by itself. This allows us to use any type of database(sqllite,mySQL,PostgreSQL) and change it during the project development without impacting the rest of the project.
\textbf{Django} uses python as programming language. Python is easy to learn and we have to learn it for our Artificial Intelligence class.
Python is also very clean and easy to read thanks to it's indentation syntax. Once again, multiple team members had experience with python which is good to get started faster.\newline

We also looked at the possibility of doing our website with PHP. Beside the fact that PHP is getting old, it is still the most used back-end language on the web. It historical security problems and the fact that the code is included inside the HTML are two main reasons why we didn't chose PHP.\newline

Ruby seems like a pretty good option as well and looked a lot like python but none of our team members had experience with it. JavaScript was another option but the only framework that some team member knew with JavaScript is \textbf{NodeJS} which was used in a previous project. Most people didn't have a good experience with it(setting up the project may be long and there are a lot of differents middle wares to install to make your project running).

\subsubsection{Front-End development}

There are lots of tool to build the website design. The three main tools are HTML (creating the web site elements), CSS (customize elements with color, placement and more) and JavaScript (used for validation, animation, forms, etc). Like the back end, there are frameworks build around those tools making the design building easier, better and faster. We will mainly use \textbf{Bootstrap}. It's a framework using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for developing responsive website for desktop and mobile. \textbf{Bootstrap} alone isn't enough to build the whole website design. An other framework we are planning to use is \textbf{Angular JS}. It extends HTML with new attributes to handle events, forms, input, validation and more. With those two framework we'll be able to build to most part of the application. We'll just need to add some more CSS to customize it.

\subsubsection{Management}

We are using \textbf{Git} to have a repository for our codes and reports or the project. We'll also use \textbf{Trello}, a free web-based project management application using kanban paradigm. Both \textbf{Git} and \textbf{Trello} were used in the project 4 last year and we all are familiar with these tools.

We will use Trello as a kanban and GitHub as a host for the code. \newline
