\section{Choice of the development methodology (25/09/2015)}

\subsection{Software development method}

\todo[inline]{C'est juste des id√©es\ldots}

We decide to choose \enquote{Agile} with Scrum as a development method because
everyone in the team worked at least once with this method (in the 4th
project of computer science bachelor) and it fits perfectly with this
kind of project with 8 team members.\newline

For the design part of the website, \textbf{Bootstrap} looks like the
best solution, because we may need to make a website that is accessible
aswell from a computer and from a mobile device. \newline

For the back-end part, \textbf{Django} is our choice because it's a Web
Framework in Python that is free, open source, secure and fast.
\newline

Some of us already know how to use those tools, others will learn as
fast as they can, following the requirements decided in the initial
planning. \newline

We will use Trello as a kanban and GitHub as a host for the code. \newline
