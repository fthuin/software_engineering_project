\label{sec:Conclusion}

This concludes our report on the website that we implemented. 
We are proud of having deployed an application that is almost complete, 
in that almost all the requirements of the client have been implemented. \newline

While a few things could still be improved, we believe that we have performed
an implementation that will be able to solve the day-to-day needs of the
client, a versatile, yet intuitive platform to host their
tournament. We now look forward to the coming live demonstration, and hope that
you will enjoy the end product.
