\todo[inline]{Faire une conclusion; dire de quoi on est fier, de quoi on
est moins fier, quelles sont les forces et faiblesses de notre site.}

This concludes our report on our website implementation. We are proud of 
having deployed an application that is almost complete, in that almost all 
the requirements of the client have been implemented. \newline

While a few things could still be improved, we believe that we have performed
an implementation that will be able to solve the day-to-day needs of the
client, a versatile, yet intuitive platform to host their
tournament. We now look forward to the coming live demonstration, and hope that
you will enjoy the end product.
