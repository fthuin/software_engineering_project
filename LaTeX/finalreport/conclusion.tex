\todo[inline]{Faire une conclusion; dire de quoi on est fier, de quoi on
est moins fier, quelles sont les forces et faiblesses de notre site.}

This concludes our report on the website implementation. We are proud of having deployed
an almost complete implementation requirement wise and of the work accomplished in general.

While a few things could still be improved, we believe that we have completed an implementation that will be able to solve the day to day need of our client by creating
versatile yet intuitive platform to host their tournament. We now look forward to the
coming live demonstration and hope that you will enjoy the end product and chose to use
it in the future.
