\todo[inline]{Faire une explication de ce que chacun a fait ; de la
répartition des tâches et de ce qui a permis d'arriver au résultat}

The task separation in our team was rather hierarchic during this project. Florian as the project manager was in charge of communicating with the client and teachers, of knowing what was happening where in the code and of coordinating us all depending on the sprint's need. 

Quentin and Nicola where responsible for the front-end (design) and back-end respectively, being the two most experienced with Django, they were put in charge of the most difficult part so that they could benefit of that experience and augment the quality of the project as much as possible. 

Finally Cyril, Benjamin, Zacharie, Romain and Alexandre where each week affected task depending on the current sprint goals. While they had no precise job of which they were responsible of, they of course weren't idle either and worked hard to meet the deadlines.

This made our group rather flexible to react in time of need, because their was always someone knowing what had been done where, we could easily change team to react to any delay that may occur. This brought us to this end result, which we believe we can be proud of.
