For the past few weeks, we were asked to develop and implement a new version of the ASMAE tennis tournament "Le Charles de Lorraine" website, based on several requirements given by the client. This was achieved over 6 sprints, each of them concentrated on particular parts of the project. In this final report, we will present the result of these sprints by first introducing our architectural choices, followed by the presentation of the main requirements for the website. After that, we will elaborate on the teamwork of the group, and give a detailed class diagram of our solution.
