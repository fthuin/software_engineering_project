For the past few weeks, we were asked to develop and implement a new version of
the ASMAE tennis tournament \enquote{Le Charles de Lorraine} website, based on
several requirements given by the client.\newline

The task has been achieved over 6
development sprints of 2 weeks long with each sprint focused on particular
parts of the project. In this final report, we will present the result of these
sprints by introducing our architectural choices, followed by a presentation of
the main requirements for the web application. After that, we will give a
commentary on the teamwork, and give the detailed class diagram of our
implementation.
