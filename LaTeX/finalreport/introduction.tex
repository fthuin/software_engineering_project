For the past few weeks, we were asked to develop and implement a new version of the ASMAE tennis tournament "Le Charles de Lorraine" website, based on several requirements given by the client. The task has been achieved over 6 development sprints of 2 weeks long, and each sprint focused on many particular parts of the project. In this final report, we will present the result of these sprints by introducing our architectural choices, followed by a presentation of the main requirements for the web application. After that, we will give a commentary on the teamwork, and give the detailed class diagram of our implementation.
